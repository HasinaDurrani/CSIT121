        <p>Although it was slightly difficult getting started, after learning how to publish an HTML file, I finally got the hang of it and no longer feel afraid of these topics. I was very worried I wouldn't get it at all since I was slightly behind, but I finally grasped the idea. Learning how to structure with HTML helps me understand the production behind webpages, including my own website.</p>
