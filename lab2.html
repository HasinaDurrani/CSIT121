    <h2>Labs 1 & 2 Reflection</h2>

        Although it was slightly difficult getting started, after learning how to publish an HTML file, 
        I finally got the hang of it and no longer feel afraid of these topics. I was very worried I wouldn't get it at all 
        since I was slightly behind, but I finally grasped the idea. Learning how to structure with HTML helps me understand 
        the production behind webpages, including my own website.
