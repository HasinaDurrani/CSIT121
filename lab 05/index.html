        <p>Although it was slightly difficult getting started, after learning how to publish an HTML file, I finally got the hang of it and no longer feel afraid of these topics. I was very worried I wouldn't get it at all since I was slightly behind, but I finally grasped the idea. Learning how to structure with HTML helps me understand the production behind webpages, including my own website.</p>
        
        <p><strong>What I Learned</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>I learned how to structure an HTML.</li>
            <li>I learned how to use VSCode and GitHub to help bring my projects together.</li>
            <li>I learned how to organize all my files. Simple as it is, it was not something I knew before.</li>
            <li>I learned a lot from BroCode YouTube channel linked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Learning about HTML coding and formatting again came mostly from BroCode, linked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Since lab 2, I’ve learned more about external stylesheets and how CSS can enhance the visual structure of a webpage. I’ve also improved my understanding of linking files in HTML.</p>

        <h2 id="lab03">Lab 3 Reflection</h2>
        <p><em>Published on September 22, 2024 by Hasina Durrani</em></p>
        <p>This lab focused on using CSS to style my HTML. I enjoyed learning how to create a visually appealing layout and how styles can affect the user experience. It was a good challenge that taught me how to combine my HTML and CSS skills. I learned about classes and IDs in CSS and how they help to apply styles to specific elements on the page.</p>
        <p>Overall, I feel more confident about designing webpages now. I liked seeing how small changes in CSS can really change the look of my page.</p>

        <h2 id="lab05">Lab 5 Reflection</h2>
        <p><em>Published on October 6, 2024 by Hasina Durrani</em></p>
        <p>In this lab, I learned how to create a responsive design using CSS flexbox and media queries. It was exciting to see how the layout changed based on the screen size. I also implemented internal navigation, which made the page easier to navigate. I realized how important it is for websites to look good on all devices.</p>
        <p>Best design practices I learned include keeping the layout simple, using consistent color schemes, and ensuring text is readable on all devices. This experience will help me create more user-friendly designs in the future. I also learned to think about how users will interact with my page, making it easier for them to find what they need.</p>
