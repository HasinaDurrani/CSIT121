            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Hasina! I am majoring in IT, and this is my second year here at CCBC.
                I will be transferring to UMBC afterwards to get my masters :) I owned a little business
                with my family that requires a shopify online store, so seeing the behind the scenes
                through this course really puts things into a different perspective. I was born in Califronia, but my parents and 
                family are all from Afghanistan. <input type="text" name="" id="">
