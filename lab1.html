        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Hasina! I am majoring in IT, and this is my second year here at CCBC.
            I will be transferring to UMBC afterwards to get my master's :) I owned a little business
            with my family that requires a Shopify online store, so seeing the behind the scenes
            through this course really puts things into a different perspective. I was born in California, but my parents and 
            family are all from Afghanistan.
