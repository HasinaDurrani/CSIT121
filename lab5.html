        Although it was slightly difficult getting started, after learning how to publish an HTML file, 
        I finally got the hang of it and no longer feel afraid of these topics. I was very worried I 
        wouldn't get it at all since I was slightly behind, but I finally grasped the idea. 
        Learning how to structure with HTML helps me understand the production behind webpages, 
        including my own website.

        This lab focused on using CSS to style my HTML. I enjoyed learning how to create a visually 
        appealing layout and how styles can affect the user experience. It was a good challenge that 
        taught me how to combine my HTML and CSS skills. I learned about classes and IDs in CSS and 
        how they help to apply styles to specific elements on the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, I feel more confident about designing webpages now. I liked seeing how small changes 
        in CSS can change the look of my page dramatically.

        In this lab, I learned how to create a responsive design using CSS Flexbox and media queries. 
        It was exciting to see how the layout changed based on the screen size. I also implemented 
        internal navigation, which made the page easier to navigate. I realized how important it is 
        for websites to look good on all devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Best design practices I learned include keeping the layout simple, using consistent color schemes, 
        and ensuring text is readable on all devices. This experience will help me create more user-friendly 
        designs in the future. I also learned to think about how users will interact with my page, making 
        it easier for them to find what they need.
